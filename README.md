# Apps Swift

These are some small apps which I made as a part of learning Swift. These apps are compatible for all iphone sizes and work in both orientations of the iphone - i.e. potrait and landscape. Below is a description for each of the apps :
1. Cat Age - Calculates your cat's age in human years and displays the answer on the screen.

2. Multiplication Tables - Displays mutiplication tables using a slider.

3. Odd or Even - The user has to guess the parity of the number the computer is holding up. The number is generated with the use of random number generator.

4. Prime Number Checker - This app checks whether the number entered by the user is prime or not

5. iWatch - A simple stopwatch that can be paused and reset.
